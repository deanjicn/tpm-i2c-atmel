ATMEL's AT97SC3204T I2C TPM -- Linux Kernel Driver

Instructions:

0. Purchase a Beaglebone rev A5+.
1. Install an ARMv7 cross compiler, update the Makefile with the location. See: 
  http://prosauce.org/blog/2012/7/5/embedded-trust-p1-beginning-to-trust-my-beaglebone.html 
  for help on building your own.
2. Compile a 3.0 (tested on 3.2) Linux kernel and a compatible u-boot, 
  update the Makefile with the location of the source, also see above link.
2.1 Patch you're board-am335xevm.c using patches/bb-ra5-add-i2c1.patch.
  [kernel-dir] $ patch -p1 < /loc/of/patches/bb-ra5-add-i2c1.patch
  This will enable the i2c-2 bus. The BB spec identifies i2c-2 for use with
  peripherals. 
3. KERNEL_DIR=/location CROSS_COMPILER=/location/bin/arm-linux- make
4. Copy the .ko to the Beaglebone: insmod ./tpm_i2c_atmel.ko

The TPM will need initialization; TrouSerS's tpm_tools can do this from userspace.

0. git clone git://trousers.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/trousers/trousers
1. git clone git://trousers.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/trousers/tpm-tools
2. Follow the directions for both, tpm-tools depends on TrouSerS.
3. ./tpm-tools/src/tpm_mgmt/tpm_startup

Note: newer versions of the Linux Kernel support TPM initialization and self test.
  We expect U-boot to have issued a startup and self test, similar to platforms 
  implementing TPM in BIOS.
Note: The bbone-target-config.ccxml is from the Beaglebone website:
